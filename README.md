# Elevator Simulation

---

This program simulates an elevator system that services requests from both outside floor call buttons (Up/Down) and inside-car floor buttons. The core functionality includes:

- Moving up/down between floors
- Stopping at requested floors
- Emergency stop system
- Reporting the current floor and direction of travel (UP/DOWN)

### Possible Extensions

- Multiple elevators working together to handle requests more efficiently
- Timing delays to simulate real-world response times
- Passenger limits to prevent overcrowding
- Error handling for invalid floor numbers or out-of-range requests
